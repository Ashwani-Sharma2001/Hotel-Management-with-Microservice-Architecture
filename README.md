Below is a template for your README file to describe your Java Spring Boot backend project utilizing microservices architecture without using Eureka Server for service discovery. This README should provide a comprehensive overview of your project, including its purpose, features, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

Microservices Backend with Spring Boot

Overview
This project is a Java Spring Boot backend application built on a microservices architecture. It consists of three services: Hotel Portion, Rating Portion, and User Portion. The services communicate with each other through a Eureka Server for service discovery.
It has Enabled Spring Security with Jwt_Token.

Features
Hotel Portion Service: Manages hotel-related functionalities such as creating, updating, and retrieving hotel information.
Rating Portion Service: Handles rating functionalities for hotels.
User Portion Service: Manages user-related operations like user authentication and profile management.
Eureka Server: Provides service discovery and registration for microservices.
Communication: Utilizes RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.

Prerequisites
Java JDK (11 or later)
Maven
Docker (for running Eureka Server)
